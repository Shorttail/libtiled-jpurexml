libtiled-jpurexml is a java library to parse [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) tmx maps.

This particular fork adds support for compression and drops support for gwt.

If you want to add support for gwt once again, feel free to do so. Likely it will be accepted upstream as well.

Usage sample: [TestTmxLoader.java](src/test/java/im/bci/test/TestTmxLoader.java)
